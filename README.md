# Project Overview: A Scalable & Real-Time Data Pipeline for IoT

This repository houses a powerful Kafka Streams application serving as the backbone of my comprehensive IoT monitoring solution. This project empowers you to:

## Ingest High-Volume Data

Seamlessly capture critical health metrics and environmental logs from your IoT devices at breathtaking speed, with data generation occurring every single second.

## Real-Time Processing & Aggregation

Leverage the exceptional capabilities of Apache Kafka Streams to efficiently process and aggregate this continuous data stream. Every five minutes, the system compresses and prepares the data for further analysis.

## Parallel Processing & Scalable Storage

Employ the robust multi-threading capabilities of Java to concurrently consume and store aggregated data in MongoDB, a highly scalable NoSQL database, ensuring exceptional retrieval performance.

## Actionable Insights & Alerts

Gain clear visual insights into your data through interactive graphs, generated by extracting and analyzing aggregated records stored in MongoDB. Proactive alerts notify you of any abnormalities exceeding your defined thresholds, empowering you to react swiftly to potential issues.

This project delivers a versatile and performant data pipeline, providing a strong foundation for building robust and insightful IoT monitoring applications.

## Key Features

### IoT Data Collection and Aggregation

Leverages IoT devices to generate health metrics and environmental logs at a high-frequency interval of one second. Employs Apache Kafka for efficient data streaming and aggregation, condensing data into five-minute intervals for further processing.

### Parallel Data Consumption and Storage

Utilizes consumer groups to enable parallel consumption of data streams for optimized performance. Stores the aggregated data in MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, ensuring efficient retrieval and analysis.

### Visual Data Representation and Alerting

Provides informative data visualizations through graphs, generated by retrieving records from MongoDB and performing performant calculations. Implements a proactive alerting mechanism to notify users when IoT monitoring detects abnormal or unusual patterns, surpassing defined thresholds.

# Project Setup

## Prerequisites:

To successfully set up this project, ensure you have the following software and dependencies installed:

- Programming Language: Java 17 (or a compatible version)
- Data Streaming and Messaging Platform: Apache Kafka 3.6.0 (or a compatible version)
- Database: MongoDB (version compatible with your Java driver)
- Additional Libraries: Apache Kafka Streams API for Java, MongoDB Java Driver

## Installation:

1. **Apache Kafka:**
   Refer to the official [Apache Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) for detailed installation instructions.

2. **MongoDB:**
   Follow the official [MongoDB installation guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) for your operating system.

3. **Java Libraries:**
   Utilize your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to manage and install the required Java libraries.

## Configuration:

- **Kafka:**
  Configure Kafka brokers and topics as needed for your application. Provide instructions for configuration settings specific to your project.

- **MongoDB:**
  Set up a MongoDB database and collection to store the aggregated data. Outline any necessary configuration steps, including database credentials and connection details.

- **Java Application:**
  Provide specific instructions on configuring properties or settings within your Java application, such as Kafka broker addresses and MongoDB connection strings.

## Environment Variables:

Consider using environment variables to store sensitive configuration details (e.g., database credentials) for security and flexibility.
